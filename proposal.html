        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>The issue we are hoping to address is the financial struggles of small businesses in Seattle that have been impacted by COVID and crime in recent years. Small businesses in Seattle (those with less than 50 employees) make up 95 percent of Seattle’s companies, making this issue a massive portion of the city’s economy. For both cultural and economic reasons, the presence of small businesses enables minorities to thrive within their communities.</p>
        <p>The information problem that needs to be addressed is the lack of awareness on how small businesses have struggled in recent years. If consumers were to have a centralized platform that not only led them to such businesses, along with information about how severe the problem is, then there would be increased attention and potential sales.</p>
